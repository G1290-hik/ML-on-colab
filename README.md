# Taxi Data Analysis Project

This project involves the analysis and visualization of NYC's Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) trip records obtained from Uber, using R programming language.

## Overview

The dataset used in this project is a subset of NYC's TLC Uber trip records, containing information about 100k trips. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, and it represents a portion of the comprehensive trip data.

## Dataset Details

- **Dataset Source:** [Kaggle - Uber Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/praveenluppunda/uber-dataset)
- **Original TLC Data Source:** [NYC TLC Trip Records - TLC](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf)

## Requirements

To run the analysis and visualization code in this project, you'll need the following:

- R programming language
- Required R packages: ggplot2, dplyr, corrplot (for correlation heatmap), etc. (mentioned in the code)

## Usage

1. **Installation:**
   - Ensure R is installed on your machine.
   - Install required packages using `install.packages("package_name")`.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - Load your dataset into R (replace `taxi_data` with your dataset's name).
   - Ensure the necessary columns exist and are properly formatted for analysis.

3. **Visualizations:**
   - Use the provided R code to create various visualizations using ggplot2 and other packages.
   - Modify the code to suit your specific visualization needs and dataset structure.

## Files Included

- `analysis_script.R`: R script containing code for data analysis and visualization.
- `your_dataset.csv` (or other file format): Sample dataset used in the analysis (replace with your actual dataset).
- `README.md`: Documentation providing an overview of the project.
